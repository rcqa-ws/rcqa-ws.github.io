# Open Poster Session<a name="open-poster-session"></a>

To encourage participation from the community at large, as well as to take advantage of AAAI 2020's co-location (in New York, NY) with leading industrial and academic research labs, we are pleased to announce an *Open Poster Session* on the day of the workshop. If you are a workshop registrant or AAAI participant, and have work that is [relevant to the topic of the RCQA workshop](https://rcqa-ws.github.io/cfp), we invite you to bring your work in the form of a poster for presentation during our [open poster session](program.md) -- to be held between 3pm and 4pm on the day of the workshop. 

Please send your poster (preferably, or a description of your work) to [Pavan Kapanipathi](mailto:kapanipa@us.ibm.com) with the subject line ``RCQA-20: Open Poster Session`` so that we can ensure the suitability and relevance of the work to the workshop. 

<sub><sup>RCQA-20 is non-archival, which means that presenting at our poster session should not preclude or be precluded by presentation of your work elsewhere. Open poster session participants will need to bring their own exhibition materials, as AAAI will only provide exhibition materials for papers accepted to the workshop program.</sup></sub>
