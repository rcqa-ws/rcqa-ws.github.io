## About<a name="about"></a>

<!-- Question Answering (QA) has become a crucial application problem in evaluating the progress of AI systems in the realm of natural language processing and understanding, and to measure the progress of machine intelligence in general. At AAAI-20, the Reasoning for Complex Question Answering (RCQA) workshop series will feature a special focus on Commonsense Reasoning, and the overall umbrella area of Machine Common Sense (MCS). Commonsense Reasoning has long been a problem of interest to the AI community, and has spurred various efforts over the years that seek to standardize and encode commonsense knowledge for use by various AI systems. Machine Common Sense (MCS), taking after the name of a recent DARPA program, has once again become an area of focus. A large part of this is due to the realization that MCS may be the one of the biggest missing components in the transition of current day narrow AI systems into truly broader general AI systems.

Making progress on the MCS problem unlocks many potential solution techniques for AI systems, and makes them truly useful in various real world domains in related fields such as NLP and Computer Vision. However, such progress is contingent on addressing key problems such as: how to obtain commonsense knowledge; how to encode it into usable models and structures that are suitably agnostic of the specific reasoning technique employed; the (automated) construction of large-scale and cross-domain knowledge bases that store such knowledge; and measuring the progress in the state-of-the-art models and showing an advantage from using commonsense knowledge on standardized datasets. -->

The RCQA 2020 [workshop](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-20/ws20/) was held under the auspices of [AAAI 2020](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-20/#) on February 8, 2020 (Saturday) at the Hilton Midtown in New York, NY. Please use the links above to find information about the workshop. Please contact [Kartik Talamadupula](mailto:krtalamad@us.ibm.com) for questions about the workshop.
