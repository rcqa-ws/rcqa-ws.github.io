  title: "Integrating Logical and Vector Representations and Using Plan-Based Understanding for Complex QA" 
  abstract: "Both logical and vector representations of natural language semantics have strengths and weaknesses.  Integrating both representations can improve reasoning for complex QA. We will review our previous work on using Markov Logic for such integration and discuss more recent neuro-symbolic approaches.  Plan-based narrative understanding, on the other hand, is an approach introduced in the 1970's that tried to produce “causal explanations” of characters actions in a story in terms of their plans and goals, allowing comprehension of narrative text that effectively supports answering “why” questions.  We will review early work on this approach and its use in Explanation Based Learning, and discuss our on-going work on using deep-learning to modernize plan-based understanding and make it more robust."

  title: "Towards AI systems that can build coherent causal models of what they read!"
  abstract: "There has been a tremendous progress in machine comprehension in the past couple of years, measured through various AI benchmarks. But are these models capable of building a coherent mental model of what they read? Humans make countless implicit commonsense inferences about everyday situations. When even young children read or listen to a narrative, they construct an elaborate mental model of what happened and why, combining the presented information with relevant background knowledge to construct the causal chain that describes how the events unfolded. Though humans build such mental models of situations with ease, AI systems for tasks such as reading comprehension remain far from exhibiting similar commonsense reasoning capability. Two major bottlenecks have been acquiring commonsense knowledge and finding ways to incorporate it into the state-of-the-art AI systems. In this talk, I will introduce a brand new commonsense reasoning framework and benchmark that helps solve both problems at scale!"

  title: "Why (and how) should we study Question Answering?"
  abstract: "Recent work has shown exceptional performance on some QA datasets, along with lack of generalization and embarrassing performance in many situations. 
It seems clear that supporting high level decisions that depend on natural language understanding is still beyond our capabilities, partly since most of these tasks are sparse and our current methodology of generating supervision signals for it does not scale. 
What should we expect from research on QA then? And how should we think about the role of the various datasets and methodologies developed in this area? I will discuss these issues in the context of some recent results exhibiting the role of QA in improving latent semantic representations, and some positive and negative results on our ability to support some levels of reasoning over text.

  title: "Evaluating and Testing Question Answering Capabilities"
  abstract: "Current evaluation of question answering primarily consists of measuring the accuracy of identifying the answer of a question from a set of choices (explicitly multi-choice or all possible spans) on held-out QA pairs. Since the held-out pairs are often gathered using similar annotation process as the training data, they include the same biases that act as shortcuts for reasoning, allowing machine learning models to achieve accurate results, without requiring actual comprehension. Thus accuracy is a poor proxy for generalization for reading comprehension tasks.

In this talk, I will introduce a number of approaches we are investigating to perform a more thorough evaluation of QA systems. I will first describe automated techniques for perturbing instances in the dataset that identify loopholes and shortcuts in the question-answering process, including semantic adversaries and universal triggers. I will then describe recent work in creating comprehensive and thorough tests and evaluation benchmarks for question answering, that aim to evaluate reading comprehension capabilities of question answering systems."

  abstract: "ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that aims to represent the basic things about word meanings that people know and computers inherently don’t. The ways in which it is used have changed a lot over its 20-year history. In our present context of powerful neural language models that are used for question answering, text generation, story understanding, and many other tasks, we can still see mistakes that would be improved by computational common sense, and sometimes the knowledge in ConceptNet can help. I’ll discuss how ConceptNet is integrated with various recent machine learning systems, how this relationship is evolving, and some best practices for using it."

  title: "Knowledge-aware Machine Reading for Question Answering" 
  abstract: "Recent years have seen a lot of progress in the development of machine reading systems for question answering. In order to correctly answer questions, a system needs to not only understand the question, but also gather relevant information, and synthesize it to produce a coherent answer. In practice, the information that is required for answering questions is often not provided to the system in a well-organized form. Instead, it can be embedded in disparate sources, such as the web, books, domain expertise, and personal experience. How to effectively distill knowledge from these sources and use it for question answering? In this talk, I will discuss machine reading models that are capable of leveraging internal/external knowledge for question answering and describe the remaining challenges of these models for real-world question answering problems."
  bio: "Bishan Yang’s interests are in building machine learning algorithms that can extract, organize, and analyze actionable information from large volumes of data.
